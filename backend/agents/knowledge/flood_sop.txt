Flood Response SOP:

- Prioritize rescue of trapped households in low-lying zones.
- Avoid dispatch through roads marked as blocked or high contamination.
- Reallocate resources if cluster demand exceeds 70% of available capacity.
- Monitor waterborne disease risk after 12+ hours of standing water.
- Ensure communication with local volunteers.
